## tl; dr  
- In this report we show the identifiability issue arised in the uncentered parametrization of the mixed-effects model for marker counts through a simple simulation example.   
- We tested whether the centered parametrization can alleviate the identifiability issue on the same toy example  
- The identifiability issue might not affect the hypothesis testing results, but the inference on $\Omega$ could be problematic.   
- We implemented and tested the sampler that allows distinct element-wise shrinkage in the graphical lasso prior
