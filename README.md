This repository contains all datasets and source code needed to reproduce the simulation examples and case study in "Microbiome compositional analysis with logistic-tree normal models".

The folder "res" contains the raw data.

The folder "src" contains the source code. 
- src/data: code for data processing.
- src/simulation: code for numerical examples in the paper (section 3).
- src/application: code for case study in the paper (section 4).

The file "run.sh" demonstrates the workflow. The numerical examples were run on a computing cluster with SLURM job scheduler.
